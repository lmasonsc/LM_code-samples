    "**Note:** *This is code from my Applied Time Series Analysis (ATSA) course. Originally, I wrote this code in RStudio. While I have less experience with Python than R and Stata, I wanted to demonstrate my ability to use Python for statistical analysis. Therefore, I took one of my earlier problem sets in the ATSA class and performed the assignment in Python. More of my comments are below.*"

    "*In this problem, I generate a random walk time series with mean 1, standard deviation 10, and starting point a_0 = -2.3. I calculate the mean and variance of the random walk. A plot of this walk is visible below. I then run 500 simulations of the random walk, compute the average mean and variance, and compare the sample mean and variance to the theoretical mean and variance.*"
